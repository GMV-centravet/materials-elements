# Contributing to Materials-UI

We would be glad to receive your help developing this Stencil components library :wink:

There are many ways for to contribute :

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Adding new components

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Before making a Pull Request

Make sure you discussed with the team by creating issue or with e-mails, to ensure your pull request goes in the same direction as current developements ðŸ™‚

When your code is ready, send the team a PR so we can discuss about changes.

## All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed the APIs, update the documentation generate it (`npm build --docs`).
4. Update site documentation in site subproject (`npm run generate:apis`)
5. If you've added a new component add its documentation and a demo in the site subproject
6. Ensure the test suite passes. (`npm test`)
7. Make sure your code lints. (`npm run eslint`)
8. Issue that pull request!
